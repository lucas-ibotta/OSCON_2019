# Increasing Access to Public Lands with Open Forest
* Laura - Director of Login.gov
* Amber - US forest service

# National Forest Servie
* 154 forests
* Permits for mushroom foraging, rafting, trees
* varying workflows and features for all those requests
* mission: "meeting the needs of present and future generations"

## Public Facing Opportunities
* experiences are inconsistent permit experiences
* info was not online in the same way at each forest
* expecting modern, digital solutions
* manually processing permits was duplicative

## 18F
* embedded digital consultancy that partner with federal agencies
* build and hand-off these projects

## Open Forest
* friendly, open source interactive site for forest access
* pilot program was a pay and print-at-home Christmas tree permit, launched in 2018
* https://openforest.fs.usda.gov/christmas-trees/forests
* special uses and guide permits are coming soon
* done in partnership with 18f, forest service and stakeholders

## Open Source Work
* daily open source collaboration
* https://github.com/18F/fs-open-forest
* https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/
* Cost effective way to get this work done
* Reusability, transparency, flexibility

## Reusability
* Using existing microservices like pay.gov and cloud.gov
* Payment, hosting, auth, visual design, emails

## Transparency
* Node, Angular
* Cloud.gov is cloud foundry
* Login.gov is a rails app

## Legacy Systems
* dealing with legacy data stores and APIss
* 5 API calls to make a permit request, they built a new interface for one
* The SVG template permit is now open source so "someone could fake this I guess... oops"

## Benefits
* Open source helped with a cultural transition

## Q&A
* Recreational Fees for certain trailheads? This was a proof of concept.
