* A 30 minute, calculated scatter shot

## Refactoring
* changing code without changing the effect of the code
* rewording essentially

## Code Safety
* it is unsafe though
* testing is what make it safe enough

## Modes
* adding new function
* fixing bugs
* refactoring, which is entirely neutral to features or bugs
* keep the intention clear in your commits too

## Forces
* creating or altering code
* over optimizing for the future hurts readability because its a mental context
* vocabulary is the most fundamental thing to understand

* I should document this.
* What can I change so this code is self documenting instead of code
* "Oh no. This cannot have been doing this the whole time."
* Line it up, even if it breaks your linter. It helps you register patterns.
